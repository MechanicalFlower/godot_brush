</div>

## How does it work?

Firstly, switch to brush mode, using the "Brush" button in the toolbar above the viewport.

Select an object (scene, models ...) in your filesystem dock, and move your mouse to place it.

You can :
- scale it by scrolling
- rotate it by moving the mouse while holding Shift
- undo and redo actions
